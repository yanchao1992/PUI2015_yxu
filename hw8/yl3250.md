This graph is clear. It has units, labels and legends. But using large points can lead to overlapping problems, which is seen in it. It is a nice graph for it has grid and the colors are okay. The only thing that may need further improvement is the color of point which representing Atlanta. It is light blue, which is similar to dark blue and it seems not so distinguishable among the dark blue points. Also, the graph could be bigger for better understanding. And it is better for the y and x axis start from the origin. It is a good point that the graph emphasizes on some large citis in America. Overall, it is a good graph.
