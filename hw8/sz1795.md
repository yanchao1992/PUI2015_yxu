In terms of clarity, it is clear for me to understand the whole idea. But it may need some improvements in labelling the axis. For instance, I do not know what exactly "Ldmk" means. I guess it stands for landmark. Also, I do not know what measurement the graph is using to describe distance and rate. Another guess, they are kilometers and English pounds. 
The graph is beautiful since the colors are easy to distinguish. It has gird and outlines and it is at an appropriate size. But it is a little bit weird for me that the whole graph is consist of two graphs with the same y axis. 
I can get the information that airbnb is cheaper than hotels when they are both far or near to a station or a landmark. Overall, it is a good map and I like the idea.
