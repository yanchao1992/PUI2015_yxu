It is clear for me to get the whole idea. But the lines intersect often. It is hard for me to identify in some points which age group rides more. Maybe one of the solutions is to make the graph bigger. 
I think it can make some improvements in color choice. For example, the color of 20-29 group and 40-49 group is so similar that I cannot distinguish sometime. Also, if it is larger, the graph could be more beautiful. It is good that it has grid. 
From the graph, I can get the the ranking of every age group's ridership during the day and their fraction against total since the total line is also drawn. However, the lines are so sticky to each other so the information is not perfectly delivered. It is an acceptable graph overall.
